            <h1>What is CumCoin?</h1>
            <h2>It's in the name</h2>
            <p>
                The internet is filled with thousands of cryptocurrencies. The
                market is dominated by coins that are either way too expensive
                or insanely cheap, and most coins are simply short lived fads.
                CumCoin is none of this.
            </p>
            <p>
                Lots of new coins promise to be the foundation of a new, better
                coin. CumCoin, on the other hand, IS the new, better coin.
                Designed with stability and longevity in mind, CumCoin will not
                be releasing a sequel, but it will continue to improve.
            </p>
            <h2>CumCoin is not another useless fad</h2>
            <p>
                CumCoin is here to stay. No fancy new revolutionary technologies
                are promised here. No raising funds for yet another crypto
                exchange. That's what makes CumCoin so good - there is no
                confusing underlying complexity.
            </p>
            <p>
                CumCoin is a friendly token that's easy to use, compatible with
                all ERC-20 wallets - you can use existing wallets like MetaMask
                without needing yet another wallet to worry about. Transactions
                with CumCoin are designed to be super cheap, and using the tried
                and true Ethereum blockchain, it's stupid easy to send CUM to
                anyone.
            </p>

            <h1>Tokenomics</h1>
            <h2>Supply</h2>
            <p>
                The total supply of CUM is capped at 690,420,000. This is the
                maximum amount of CumCoins that will exist.
            </p>
            <h2>Distribution</h2>
            <p>
                A pool of 30,000,000 CUM is allocated for the creators and
                initial funders of the coin. An additional 200,000,000 CUM will
                be distributed through a decentralized crowdsale. The remaining
                coins will be distributed through UniSwap. UniSwap liquidity
                will be determined by Ethereum raised in the crowdsale.
            </p>
            <h2>Upgradeability</h2>
            <p>
                Using OpenZeppelin upgradeable ERC20 contracts, CumCoin can be
                upgraded in the case an exploit is found or the community has
                agreed on some changes. None of these upgrades will be decided
                on and added to the blockchain until a big majority of the
                community has agreed on them, and all proposed changes will be
                published to the official Github repository first.
            </p>

                    Before contributing, read this. While we all believe in
                    CumCoin and want it to be successful, you need to be aware
                    of the risks involved before making any contributions.
                    That's why we want to make this clear: don't contribute more
                    than you're prepared to lose. When you contribute to
                    CumCoin, you're not buying CUM from anyone. Instead you're
                    interacting with a decentralized contract on the Ethereum
                    blockchain. By calling the contract's buyTokens function,
                    you are set a balance internally in the contract, which you
                    can check at any time using the balanceOf function. Note,
                    you will not receive any tokens at this point. Once the
                    crowdsale is over, you'll be able to call the withdrawTokens
                    function. Calling this function will initiate a transfer of
                    CUM from the crowdsale contract to the given address. Your
                    entire balance will be transferred to the given address,
                    after which your balance in the crowdsale will be reset to
                    0, preventing further withdrawals. By contributing to
                    CumCoin, you understand that all contributions are final,
                    and there cannot be any refunds or cancellations. You are
                    also aware that there is no business behind CumCoin - you
                    are simply interacting with a decentralized contract on the
                    Ethereum blockchain. You understand that all decisions you
                    make regarding CumCoin are your own, and you will bear their
                    consequences. Again, don't contribute more than you're
                    prepared to lose. (Click the 'I agree' button to continue if

                need to be on a browser with the MetaMask extension installed.
                The crowdsale will provide 250,000 CUM for every 1 ETH sent.
                This can only be withdrawn once the finalize function is called,
                and the finalize function is restricted to the contract
                deployer. The crowdsale will not accept more than a total of 800
                ETH, after which further contributions will be rejected. Raised
                Ethereum will be used for UniSwap liquidity.
